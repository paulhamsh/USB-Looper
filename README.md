# USB-Looper
A guitar looper pedal which uses a USB audio connection to an amplifier.

The amp must send processed guitar to the looper pedal over USB and receive audio back from the looper pedal over USB.   

Examples of amps that can do this are:   
- Spark Mini
- Boss Katana

(The Spark 40 amp has a strange pitch-shift issue with USB which makes it unusable for UBS audio)
